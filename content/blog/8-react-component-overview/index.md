In this post we will break down different technical aspects and mechanisms behind functional React component.  

These are the things that make up `functional components` mechanism:
- `import` is realized via ES6 Modules
- `useState` hook is storing data by closures and destructuring `[val, setVal]`
- `fetch` and `setTimeout` is a browser functionality  
- `TypeScript` is removed during transpile
- `jsx` is syntactic sugar for `React.createElement`
- list operations `.map` and `.find` are new ES6 features
